      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Probation Community Resources is an online interactive, searchable map. It represents a collaborative effort between the Cook County Adult Probation Department (CCAPD), the Cook County Juvenile Probation Department (CCJPD), the <a href="http://www.povertylaw.org/" target="_blank">Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law</a>, the <a href="http://www.chicagoappleseed.org/" target="_blank">Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice</a>, <a href="http://www.hmprg.org/" target="_blank">Health & Medicine Policy Research Group</a>, and <a href="https://datamade.us/" target="_blank">DataMade</a>.</p>
      <p>Probation Community Resources helps criminal justice personnel refer clients to culturally relevant and geographically specific community-based services throughout the Chicago area. On this site, users find social, health, and cultural resources by identifying client-appropriate facilities, selected by certain geographic boundaries and other search limitations, such as language and age. By facilitating access to valuable Chicago resources, this project shapes how Chicago criminal justice officers engage with their clients and communities.</p>
